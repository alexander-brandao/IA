# IA
Set of artificial intelligence algorithms

## Hill Climbing
Mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of **local search**. It is an **iterative algorithm** that starts with an **arbitrary** solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change solution.

## Breadth First
Tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It is a **searching algorithm**, it start at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

## Depth First
Is a **Searching algorithm** for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Tabu search
Search a potential solution to a problem and check its immediate neighbors in the hope of finding an improved solution. Have a tendency to become stuck in suboptimal regions or on plateaus where many solutions are equally fit.

### The 7-Eleven problem 
A customer walked into a 7-11 store and decided
to buy some items. When he brought his items
to the check-out counter, the cashier rang in
the purchases and told the customer that the cost was $7.11.
The customer was curious that the cost of his
items was the same as the store name, so he asked
the clerk how he came to that price. The clerk
responded that he had simply multiplied the prices
of the four individual items. The customer protested!
He insisted that the four prices should have been added, not multiplied.
The clerk said that it was okay with him, but, that the total was still the same: exactly $7.11.

What were the prices of the items? 

## Simulated Annealing
Probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem.
