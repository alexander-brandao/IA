# IA
Set of artificial intelligence algorithms

## Hill Climbing
Mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of **local search**. It is an **iterative algorithm** that starts with an **arbitrary** solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change solution.

## Breadth First
Tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It is a **searching algorithm**, it start at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

## Depth First
Is a **Searching algorithm** for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Tabu search
Search a potential solution to a problem and check its immediate neighbors in the hope of finding an improved solution. Have a tendency to become stuck in suboptimal regions or on plateaus where many solutions are equally fit.

## Simulated Annealing
Probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem.
